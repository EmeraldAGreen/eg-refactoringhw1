# eg-refactoringhw1

## DU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment 1.

For this assignment, I refactored existing code to make it more accessible so that the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines. 

First, I replaced non semantic elements (e.g. <div>, <span>) with descriptive semantic elements that define the content of the landing page (e.g. <body>, <section>, <article>)
Then, I added alt text to all images included. With this addition, my index.html file was complete, and I moved on to the style.css file.
I commented the CSS file to describe what each section of code was styling in the HTML and organized the .css to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
