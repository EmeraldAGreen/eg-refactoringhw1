## DU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment 1.

For this assignment, I refactored existing code to make it more accessible so that the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines. 

First, I replaced non semantic elements (e.g. <div>, <span>) with descriptive semantic elements that define the content of the landing page (e.g. <body>, <section>, <article>)
Then, I added alt text to all images included.
